    <p>Last Updated: October, 2017</p>

    <p>Digicologies Software Pvt. Ltd. (“UserNDot,” “us” or “we”) provides SaaS (software as a service) (the “Service”)
      that enables the providers of mobile applications and websites (the “App Providers”) to understand how end users
      who download, access and/or interact with App Providers’ services (the “End Users”) interact with their
      services. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose data collected
      through the UserNDot Platform (the “Platform”), as a part of our Service.</p>


    <p>European Union should be sure to read the important information provided under the section - “Additional
      Information for European Union Users” in this Privacy Policy.</p>


    <p>We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the
      new Privacy Policy on the Platform or by sending you an email or other notification prior to the changes
      becoming effective. We will also indicate when the changes will become effective. Please review our Privacy
      Policy on a regular basis. Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the
      time such information is collected.</p>


    <p>This Privacy Policy only applies to UserNDot and does not apply to the practices of companies that UserNDot does
      not own or control, or to people that UserNDot does not employ or manage.</p>


    <p>This Privacy Policy has some provisions that only apply to App Providers and End Users, respectively, and it also
      has provisions that apply to both App Providers and End Users. Please read the applicable Privacy Policy
      provisions carefully before proceeding.</p>


    <p>FOR END USERS</p>

    <p> How we collect and use information from the End Users</p>


    <p>We obtain information about End Users to provide App Providers with behavioral and analytics data related to how
      End Users interact with their products and services (the “Applications”). We do not directly get personal
      information from End Users; we collect information using tracking code technology that App Providers install in
      their Applications and share with us pursuant to their information collection practices, which are typically
      outlined in a privacy policy like this one and made available on the App Provider’s website. We encourage all
      End Users to read the privacy policies of the Applications they access or use. The App Providers provide us with
      the following types of information about End Users:</p>


    <p>When an App Provider embeds our tracking code into its Applications, we access or obtain Personally Identifiable
      Information (“PII”) such as an End User’s email address, name, and phone number, depending on the selections the
      applicable App Provider makes via the UserNDot Software Development Kits (the “SDKs”). We also access or obtain
      additional information about End Users’ use of App Providers’ Applications and End Users’ devices, such as the
      actions taken, content viewed, messages viewed, messages clicked, offers accepted, search terms entered,
      advertisements clicked, applications opened, applications sent to the background, transactions in which an End
      User engaged, application name, application version, application bundle identifier, operating system name,
      operating system version, unique device identifiers, IP addresses, and access date, time, and location
      information. Please ensure you read, understand, and accept the privacy policies, and any terms of use of the
      App Provider that uses the UserNDot Service. By using our Service, you expressly relieve UserNDot from any and
      all liability arising from your use of the App Providers service. We analyze and use this information to provide
      and improve the UserNDot Service. UserNDot collects information under the direction of our App Providers, and
      has no direct relationship with the End Users whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of
      our App Providers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our App Providers that use the UserNDot
      Service, please contact the App Provider directly. If the App Provider fails to respond to your request within
      30 days, you may contact us with your request at support@userndot.com.</p>


    <p>How long do we retain information collected from End Users?</p>


    <p>We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our App Providers for as long as needed to provide services
      to our App Providers. We will also retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal
      obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>


    <p>An End User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query
      to our App Providers. If requested by App Providers to remove or access data, we will respond within 30
      days.</p>


    <p>Communications</p>


    <p>App Providers are able to send you, the End Users, push notifications, thought in-apps or email communications
      through the UserNDot Service.</p>


    <p>Opt-Out</p>


    <p>An End User who seeks to opt-out must direct their query to their App Providers. The App Providers may then
      request us to opt-out the said End User, which we shall do so within 30 days. Alternatively, the End User may
      contact us directly, by sending opt-out requests to support@userndot.com.</p>


    <p>FOR APP PROVIDERS</p>

      this. An End User who seeks to opt-out must direct their query to their App Providers. The App Providers may

      liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on
      its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles unless UserNDot proves that it is not responsible
      for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>

      purpose of performing the UserNDot Service on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your
      PII for any other purpose. The End Users may reach us at support@userndot.com if they require further

      Provider with third parties.</p>


    <p>Information Disclosed for our Protection and the Protection of Others</p>


    <p>It is our policy to protect App Providers and End Users from having their privacy violated through abuse of the
      legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government and to contest claims that we believe to be
      invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement
      officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about App Providers
      or End Users to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion,
      believe necessary:</p>

      subpoenas, warrants or court orders;</p>

      Users (including PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information (such as
      login credentials) on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer
      technology (SSL). Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or
      storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any
      information.</p>


    <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of
      unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach
      notification) via email or conspicuous posting on our Platform in the most expedient time possible and without
      unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures
